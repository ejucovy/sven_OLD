 * Refactored path normalization in SVN backend classes and added
   optional `path_fixer` callable argument to constructor.

   If provided, `path_fixer` should expect to be called with a
   string URI as the only argument. It should return a string URI.
   It can be used to define filesystem layout policies, like
   "always store files prefixed under a date hierarchy" or "add a
   file extension."
