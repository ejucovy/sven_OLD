 * Refactored path normalization in SVN backend classes and added
   optional `path_fixer` callable argument to constructor.

   If provided, `path_fixer` should expect to be called with a
   string URI as the only argument. It should return a string URI.
   It can be used to define filesystem layout policies, like
   "always store files prefixed under a date hierarchy" or "add a
   file extension."

 * Added bazaar backend and tests.

 * Removed experimental mercurial backend. I only need "something
   faster than subversion" and Bazaar's worldview fits my brain
   better, so I doubt I'll be maintaining the mercurial backend.

 * Implemented custom resource properties for bazaar backend,
   because it doesn't have any concept like `svn propget/propset`.

   Resource properties are implemented as independently versioned
   files. File and directory properties live in separate locations,
   because that seemed easier and more logical somehow.

   For a file '/foo/bar/baz.txt' its 'mimetype' property lives at
   '/.sven-meta/.mimetype/foo/bar/baz.txt' and its 'fleem' property
   lives at '/.sven-meta/.fleem/foo/bar/baz.txt'.

   For a directory '/foo/bar/' its 'mimetype' property lives at
   '/foo/bar/.sven-meta/.mimetype' and its 'fleem' property lives
   at '/foo/bar/.sven-meta/.fleem'.

   For normal files read and written directly by the user, sven
   appends a newline to the end of the file. For these files, sven
   does not append a newline to the end of the file.
