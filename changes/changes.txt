* SvnBackend.__init__ no longer takes a 'svnuri' argument to the
  remote repository as its first positional argument; it's not
  used anywhere. This is a backwards-incompatible change.

* The strange ad-hoc JSONish object returned by SvnAccess.ls had an
  extra `/` prefixed to the object's 'href' erroneously; now fixed.

* Experimental implementation of the Sven API for Mercurial backends 
  now lives in sven.hg.HgAccess; it is documented in hg-doctest.txt
  and has a few small differences from the SvnAccess backend. It is
  highly incomplete (think of it as an alpha stage) and requires
  `mercurial` to be installed. Sven does not install mercurial, just
  like it doesn't install pysvn.
