* Removed `SvnAccess.update_after_write` knob and instead set default value of True
  to the `update_after_write` argument to `SvnAccess.write`; callers can implement
  alternatives trivially by subclassing.

* Added `update_before_write` argument to .write with default value of True. Turn
  this off as well as `update_after_write` if you want to manage synchronicity in
  exchange for potentially significant performance improvements.
