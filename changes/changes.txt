* SvnBackend.__init__ no longer takes a 'svnuri' argument to the
  remote repository as its first positional argument; it's not
  used anywhere. This is a backwards-incompatible change.

* The strange ad-hoc JSONish object returned by SvnAccess.ls had an
  extra `/` prefixed to the object's 'href' erroneously; now fixed.
