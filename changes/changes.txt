* Added simple_backend.FSAccess class, which partially implements
  the SVNAccess API, but on a plain old filesystem. Needs tests
  and documentation, among other things.

* Refactored SvnAccess to split out recently-added options for
  update_before/after_write into logically separate component

  XXX needs to be renamed for backwards compatibility before release
